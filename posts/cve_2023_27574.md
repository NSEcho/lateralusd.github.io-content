# Introduction

Recently, I started playing a bit with different methods of code injection inside the MacOS applications.  
There are a lot of methods, but the one I got the most interested is abusing `com.apple.security.get-task-allow`.

This entitlement allows other processes to obtain the applications task. Obtaining the task means you can do with the process everything you want(code execution, memory read/write etc).

At the end of this post, we will be exploiting this to write some text to the STDOUT of the application.

We will utilize mach vm API with the `thread_create_running` to execute our shellcode.

# Analysis

Application [ShadowsocksX-NG](https://github.com/shadowsocks/ShadowsocksX-NG) is MacOS client for the original shadowsocks. Shadowsocks is a tool that helps to circumvent firewalls.

To view the entitlements, we can use `codesign -dv --entitlements :- /path/to/the/binary`

```bash
$ codesign -d --entitlements :- /Applications/ShadowsocksX-NG.app/Contents/MacOS/ShadowsocksX-NG 2> /dev/null | xmllint --format -
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "https://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

We can see that the application has only entitlement, and it is `com.apple.security.get-task-allow`.
